# JavaScript-Visuals

In this project, I create 5 simple visual templates using JavaScript. 
These can be used both to discover fundamentals of JavaScript and also to add visual effects to a website or application. 
They are highly customizable, and can be applied to many other projects. I hope to do this in the future. 

## Demo: Visual 4
