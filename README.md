# JavaScript-Visuals

In this project, I create 5 simple visual templates using JavaScript. 
These can be used both to discover fundamentals of JavaScript and also to add visual effects to a website or application. \
They are highly customizable, and can be applied to many other projects. I hope to do this in the future. 

All visuals were made between February and May 2022

## To load the visual in a browser
1. You will need a Command Line Interface (CLI).
It is already included in macOS but you will need to install one if you are using Windows. I recommend Git CMD.
2. You will also need to install the backend JS runtime environment Node.js. 
3. Using the JavaScript package manager npm, install the canvas-sketch framework and additional utility functions using the commands: 
```
npm install canvas-sketch-cli -g
npm install canvas-sketch-util
```
The documentation for this framework can be accessed in the GitHub repository of [canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch), created by the artist Matt DesLauriers. 
5. To open one of the sketches, use the command: 
```
canvas-sketch sketch-01.js
```
...where "sketch-01.js" can be replaced by the name of the file.
7.  Copy the link that appears into your search bar.\ 

You can now see any of my sketches in the browser displayed on the browser of your choice. \
Use CTRL + r to reload the page and change the drawing.\
Visual 4 has many sliders that can be used to modify the visual to your liking. 

## Demo: Visual 3
This visual moves, watch the mp4 file included in this repository as an example. The dots bounce around the boundaries of the drawing and are always connected to the other dots if they are close enough. \

## Demo: Visual 5
This visual displays letters or images using a stylized look. \
This is a first example using a grid of dots to "pixelize" the letter. \

This second example uses random characters, and changes their size randomly, to outline the letter.\
